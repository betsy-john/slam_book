Hi to the contributors, this is a simple Application to test and play around with react.
The idea behind this Application is kind of Blogging out your mind, idea  frustation ,
this can be liked or disliked by anybody accessing the Application 
Front end is "React" for Obvious.
Backend (Not Decided)- can be Python or Ruby 
We would preferably like to build up basic Front end 
before setting up back end 
backend database is postgresSQl and 
postman is to be used neccesarily.
